# SequenceTagging

The goal of the project is to predict the NER (Named Entity Tags) tags of a new sequence. The models are trained using existing sequence and their NER tags. The model will predict the NER tags for the new sequence that is been inputted. 

Viterbi algorithm is used for the purpose.
